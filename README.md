# EXTG15 Final Project
By Teo Bergkvist $\pi 3$

Spring 2024

I made this project to demonstrate a cool use case of ANNs (Artificial Neural Networks) and Genetic Algorithms. 

## Setup
- Clone this repository or download the files manually.
- Make sure to have python installed.
- Run `pip install requirements.txt` inside the repository directory.
- If everything goes well, the program should now be set-up.

## Usage
- Open the ipython notebook `main.ipynb` with vs-code, jupyter notebook or some wherever you usually code.
- The notebook is well commented and needs no more explanation.

## Note
Feel free to use the code in this project. If you use it as it is, or use large parts of it, please give credit to [Teo Bergkvist](https://github.com/tbergkvist).
