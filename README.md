# Artificial Neural Networks trained by a Genetic Algorithm to play... Pong?!
Created by Teo Bergkvist $\pi 3$, as a final project in the course EXTG15 at Lund University.

I made this project to demonstrate a cool use case of ANNs (Artificial Neural Networks) and Genetic Algorithms. 

## Setup
- Clone this repository or download the files manually.
- Make sure to have python installed.
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside the repository directory.
- If everything goes well, the program should now be set-up.

#### GPU Setup
- If `speed_trainer.py` is to be used with a GPU, then `pip install cupy` has to be run as well.

## Usage
- Open the ipython notebook `main.ipynb` with vs-code, jupyter notebook or wherever you usually code.
- The notebook is well commented and needs no more explanation.

## Note
Feel free to use the code in this project. If you use it as it is, or use large parts of it, please give credit to [Teo Bergkvist](https://github.com/tbergkvist).
